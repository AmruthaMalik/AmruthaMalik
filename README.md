## Hey, I’m Amrutha 👋  

Final-year student | Aspiring Software Engineer | Problem Solver  

I’m a motivated student with a strong foundation in computer science, currently focused on building real-world skills through projects, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I enjoy turning ideas into working code and learning how systems actually behave outside textbooks.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Meta-Learning (NAS)** to automate neural network architecture generation and evaluation using a multi-agent system.
- 🌱 I’m currently strengthening my core programming skills and deepening my understanding of foundational concepts.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects, backend-driven applications, and beginner-friendly open-source contributions.
